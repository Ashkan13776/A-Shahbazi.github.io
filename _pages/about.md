My name is Ashkan Shahbazi. Ashkan is a persian name which means "Like Tears". I'm an arriving PhD student beginning with Fall 2022 at Vandy, joining to <a href="https://mint-vu.github.io/">Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://skolouri.github.io/">Dr. Soheil Kolouri</a>. Prior to joining Vandy, I obtaiend my B.Sc in biomedical engineering from the <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Amirkabir University of Technology</a>, Tehran, Iran in 2021

I am highly interested in various areas of Machnie Learning, specially for Mathematical Machine Learning, (Geometric) Deep Learning and Continual Learning. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
